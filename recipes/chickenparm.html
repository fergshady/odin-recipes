            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an oven to 450 Degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celcius).</li>
                <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic resealable freezer bags,on a solid and leveled surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of <sup>1/2</sup>inch.  </li>
                <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer;sprinke flour over the chicken breasts. Make sure both sides are evenly coated.</li>
                <li>Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a seperate bowl and set aside.</li>
                <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer the breast to the bread crumb mixture,pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast then let the chicken rest for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Proceed to heat <sup>1/2</sup>inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden,about 2 minutes per side.The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish.Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese,fresh basil,and provolone cheese to ensure maximum tastiness. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each breast with <sup>1/2</sup> teaspoon olive oil.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and the chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center,15 to 20 minutes.An instant-read thermometer inserted in the center should read at least 165 degrees fahrenheit or 74 degrees Celcius0.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
